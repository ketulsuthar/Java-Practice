7. Retirement 


Consider an input, HashMap, that contains key as the ID and DOB as value of employees. Write a program to find out employees eligible for retirement. A person is eligible for retirement if his or her age is greater than or equal to 60. 
Assume that the current date is 01/01/2014. 
Include a class UserMainCode with a static method “retirementEmployeeList” that accepts a HashMap<String,String> as input and returns an ArrayList<String>. In this method, add the Employee IDs of all the persons eligible for retirement to list and return the sorted list. 
(Assume date is in dd/MM/yyyy format). 
Create a Class Main that would get the HashMap as input and call the static method retirementEmployeeList present in the UserMainCode. 
Input and Output Format: 
The first line of the input consists of an integer n that corresponds to the number of employees. 
The next 2 lines of the input consist of strings that correspond to the id and DOB of employee 1. 
The next 2 lines of the input consist of strings that correspond to the id and DOB of employee 2. 
and so on... 
Output consists of the list of employee ids eligible for retirement in sorted order.
