4. ArrayList Manipulation 

Write a program that performs the following actions: 
1. Read 2n integers as input. 
2. Create two array lists to store n elements in each array list. 
3. Write a function generateOddEvenList that accepts these two array lists as input. 
4. The function fetches the odd index elements from first array list and even index elements from second array list and adds them to a new array list according to their index. 
5. Return the arraylist.
Include a class UserMainCode with the static method generateOddEvenList that accepts two arraylists and returns an arraylist. 
Create a Class Main that would be used to read 2n integers and call the static method present in UserMainCode. 
Note: 
- The index of first element is 0. 
- Consider 0 an even number. 
- Maintain order in the output array list 
Input and Output Format: 
Input consists of 2n+1 integers. The first integer denotes the size of the arraylist, the next n integers are values of the first arraylist, and the last n integers are values of the second arraylist. 
Output consists of a modified arraylist as per step 4. 
Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
