2. Unique Even Sum 

Write a program to read an array, eliminiate duplicate elements, and calculate the sum of even numbers (values) present in the array. 
Include a class UserMainCode with a static method addUniqueEven that accepts a single integer array. The return type (integer) should be the sum of the even numbers. In case there is no even number, it should return -1. 
Create a Class Main that would be used to accept input array and call the static method present in UserMainCode. 

Input and Output Format: 
Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array. The next “n” integers correspond to the elements in the array. 
In case there is no even integer in the input array, print no even numbers as output. Otherwise, print the sum. 
Refer the sample output for formatting specifications. 
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.
