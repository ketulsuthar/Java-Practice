5. Mastering Hashmap 

You have recently learnt about HashMaps, and in order to master them, you try and use them in all of your programs. 
Your trainer/teacher has given you the following exercise: 
1. Read 2n numbers as input, where the first number represents a key and second number represents a value. Both the numbers are of integer type. 
2. Write a function getAverageOfOdd to find out average of all values whose keys are represented by odd numbers. Assume the average is an integer and never a decimal number. Return the average as output. Include this function in class UserMainCode. 

Create a Class Main that would be used to read 2n numbers and build the hashmap. Call the static method present in UserMainCode. 
Input and Output Format: 
Input consists of 2n+ 1 integers. The first integer specifies the value of n (essentially the hashmap size). The next pair of n numbers denote the key and value. 
Output consists of an integer representing the average. 
Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
