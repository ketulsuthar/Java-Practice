1. Strings – Unique & Existing Characters 

Obtain two strings from user as input. Your program should modify the first string such that all the characters are replaced by plus sign (+), except the characters that are present in the second string. 
That is, if one or more characters of first string appear in second string, they will not be replaced by plus sign (+). 
Return the modified string as output. Note - Ignore case.
