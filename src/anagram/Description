6. Anagram 
Write a program to check whether the two given strings are anagrams. 
Note: Rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once is called “Anagram." 
Include a class UserMainCode with a static method “getAnagram” that accepts 2 strings as arguments and returns an integer. The method returns 1 if the 2 strings are anagrams. Else, it returns -1. 
Create a Class Main that would get 2 Strings as input and call the static method getAnagram present in the UserMainCode. 
Input and Output Format: 
Input consists of 2 strings. Assume that all characters in the string are lower case letters. 
Output consists of a string that is either “Anagram” or “Not Anagram.” 

Sample Input 1: 
eleven plus two 
twelve plus one 
Sample Output 1: 
Anagrams 
Sample Input 2: 
orchestra 
carthorse 
Sample Output 2: 
Anagrams 
Sample Input 3:
